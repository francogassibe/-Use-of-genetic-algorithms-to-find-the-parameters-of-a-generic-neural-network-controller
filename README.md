# NN_control_law


In this project we are looking to implement a Neural network type control law.
This doesent mean there is something to be learned like in a normal NN problem 
Means the expresion that describes the control signal U is mathematicaly equivalent to a NN

where our controller looks like this

So we have a 2nd degree system (like a mass spring one) and we want to design a complex controller that will
hopefully controll our system in a much better way that a normal PID controller 

The code is in the Bodyproject matlab file and the full explanation is in the pptx presentation
